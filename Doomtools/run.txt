:: Doom Launcher Batch Script
::
:: This script launches the specified Doom engine with configurable IWAD, WAD files,
:: and command-line options.
::
:: === How to Configure ===
:: - Edit the variables below in the "Editable Config" section to change:
::     * ENGINE_EXE        : Path to your Doom engine executable
::     * IWAD_FILE         : Path to your IWAD file (e.g. doom2.wad)
::     * MAP_WAD           : The name of the build WAD to test; this is usually
::                           located at "./build/yourmapname.wad"
::     * OPTIONAL_WAD1..5  : Optional additional WAD files to load (full paths only).
::                           Leave empty ("") to skip.
::
:: === How to Use ===
:: Run this batch file with optional command-line arguments:
::
::   -menu             : Launch the game without warping, so you see the title screen
::                       and game menu instead of starting a map.
::   -skill 4          : If a skill is not specified, it will default to -skill 4
::   -warp 1           : If a warp map is not specified, it will default to -warp 1
::
::   Additionally, all source port command-line options will be passed through
::   directly to the engine.
::   Example: -nomonsters -nosound
::
:: Examples:
::   run.bat -warp 3 -skill 2
::   run.bat -menu
::   run.bat -nosound -warp 5
::   run.bat -nomonsters -nosound -skill 1
::
:: The script prints the final command line before launching the engine.
::
::
:: === Additional DoomTools Texture Build Feature ===
::
:: If you wish to use the Texture1 trick to enable proper previews in Ultimate Doom Builder (UDB),
:: you should create two versions of your texture1.txt file:
::
::     1. "RESTRICTED" — contains only your custom texture definitions
::     2. "ALL"        — includes both custom and IWAD texture definitions
::
:: To do this:
::   - Copy the default texture1.txt
::   - Generate the full version using `doommake rebuildtextures`
::   - Save both versions in a directory of your choice
::
:: Then, in this batch file, configure the === TextureX Data === section
:: to point to that directory and the two file names.
::
:: Use the following flags to switch modes:
::   -setTxA   : Copies texture1-ALL.txt into the project directory and runs `doommake textures`
::   -setTxR   : Copies texture1-RESTRICTED.txt into the project directory and runs `doommake textures`
::
